# FaQ
**Why does Sleeky get flagged as (insert virus name here)?** Many anti-virus programs, including windows defender will flag anything that is packed/virtualized/obfuscated as malware since malware commonly uses these methods to protect themselves.

**Why does the application give me an error when using (replay player)?** Usually its because your Windows user is missing adminstaror privileges, after granting them it should work properly.
